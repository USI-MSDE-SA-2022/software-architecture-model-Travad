    <main>
        <h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>
<p>You will use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheetplan">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> to describe a software architecture model about your own project.</p>
<p>This document will grow during the semester as you sketch and refine your software architecture model.</p>
<p>When you are done with each task, please push so we can give you feedback about your work.</p>
<p>We begin by selecting a suitable project domain.</p>
<h1 id="ex---domain-selection"><span class='task'>1.</span>  Domain Selection</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>Submit the name and brief description (about 100 words) of your domain using the following vision statement template:</p>
<pre><code>For [target customers]
Who [need/opportunity/problem]
The [name your project]
Is  [type of project]
That [major features, core benefits, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [current reality or competitors]
Our Project [summarize main advantages over status quo, unique selling point]
</code></pre>
<p>Please indicate if your choice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project you have worked on in the past (by yourself or with a team)</li>
<li>a project you are going to work on this semester in another lecture (which one?)</li>
<li>a new project you plan to build in the future</li>
<li>some existing open source project you are interested to contribute to</li>
</ul>
<p>The chosen domain should be unique for each student.</p>
<p>Please be ready to give a 2 minute presentation about it (you can use a slide but it&#39;s not necessary)</p>
<section class="hint"><span>Hint: </span>to choose a meaningful project look at the rest of the modeling tasks which you are going to perform in the context of your domain.</section></section><p>Project Name: <em>FruitDash</em></p>
<p>Project Type: Web application</p>
<p>Vision Statement: 
  For small-medium enterprise employees, 
  who need to make decisions based on clear visualized information, 
  FruitDash is a web-based dashboard that displays metrics based on the fruit and vegetable orders of their clients.
  Unlike Excel, 
  Fruitdash provides the required information instantaneously to speed up the decision-making process
  and enables the sharing of consistent information across the whole company. </p>
<p>Additional Information: This is a project that I aim to build in the future. The dashboard
should be accessible by multiple users at the same time and it should be built so that it respects
conventions on how information should be displayed using tables and graphs. Furthermore, the application
will be built using ASP.NET Core Framework (C#) and SQL Server as the database technology for retrieving data.</p>
<h1 id="ex---architectural-decision-records"><span class='task'>2.</span>  Architectural Decision Records</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>Software architecture is about making design decisions that will impact the quality of the software you plan to build.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s practice how to describe an architectural decision. We will keep using ADRs to document architectural decisions in the rest of the model.</p>

<li>At least one component should already exist. You should plan how to reuse it, by locating it in some software repository and including in your model the exact link to its specification and its price.</li>
<li>At least one component should be stateful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logical view should represent provide/require dependencies that are consistent with the interactions represented in the process view.</p>

<li><p>(1) Should we find cases where two components cannot communicate (and are doing it wrongly) and highlight they would need an adapter?, or cases where we have already a &quot;component playing the role of adapter in the view&quot; and highlight only the adapter?</p>
<p><em>Both are fine. We assumed that if you draw a dependency (or a connector) the interfaces match, but if you detect that the components that should communicate cannot communicate then of course introduce an adapter to solve the mismatch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>(2) Please show the details about the two interfaces which do not match (e.g., names of parameters, object structures) so that it becomes clear why an adapter is needed and what the adapter should do to bridge the mismatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>(5-6) These questions are about the implications on coupling based on the decisions you documented in the connector view.
Whenever you have a connector you couple together the components and different connectors will have different forms of coupling</p>
<p>For example, if you use calls everywhere, do you really need them everywhere? is there some pair of components where you could use a message queue instead?</p>
<p>Regarding the coupling facets mentioned in question 5. You do not have to answer all questions related to &quot;discovery&quot;, &quot;session&quot;, &quot;binding&quot;, &quot;interaction&quot;, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; (p.441, Coupling Facets). Just the ones that you think are relevant for your design and by answering them you can get ideas on how to do question 6.</p>

</section><h1 id="ex---physical-and-deployment-views"><span class='task'>12.</span>  Physical and Deployment Views</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>a. Extend your architectural model with the following viewpoints:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Physical or Container View</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deployment View</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your model should be non-trivial: include more than one physical device/virtual container (or both). Be ready to discuss which connectors are found at the device/container boundaries.</p>
<p>b. Write an ADR about which deployment strategy you plan to adopt. The alternatives to be considered are: big bang, blue/green, shadow, pilot, gradual phase-in, canary, A/B testing.</p>
<p>c. (Optional) Prepare a demo of a basic continuous integration and delivery pipeline for your architectural documentation so that you can obtain a single, integrated PDF with all the viewpoints you have modeled so far. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>configure a GitHub webhook to be called whenever you push changes to your documentation</li>
<li>setup a GitHub action (or similar) to build and publish your documentation on a website</li>
</ul>

<section class="instructions "><p>The goal of this week is to plan how to deliver your software as a service with high availability.</p>
<ol>
<li>If necessary, change your deployment design so that your software is hosted on a server (which could be running as a Cloud VM). Your SaaS architecture should show how your SaaS can be remotely accessed from a client such as a Web browser, or a mobile app</li>
<li>Sketch your software as a service pricing model (optional)</li>
<li>How would you define the availability requirements in your project domain? For example, what would be your expectation for the duration of planned/unplanned downtimes or the longest response time tolerated by your clients?</li>
<li>Which strategy do you adopt to monitor your service&#39;s availability? Extend your architecture with a watchdog or a heartbeat monitor and motivate your choice with an ADR.</li>
<li>What happens when a stateless component goes down? model a sequence diagram to show what needs to happen to recover one of your critical stateless components</li>
<li>How do you plan to recover stateful components? write an ADR about your choice of replication strategy and whether you prefer consistency vs. availability. Also, consider whether event sourcing would help in your context.</li>
<li>How do you plan to avoid cascading failures? Be ready to discuss how the connectors (modeled in your connector view) impact the reliability of your architecture.</li>
<li>How did you mitigate the impact of your external dependencies being not available? (if applicable)</li>
</ol>

<section class="instructions "><p>Now that your architecture delivers your software as a service, let&#39;s redesign it so that it can scale!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick one scalability dimension: number of clients, size of input, size of state, number of dependencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>How well does your architecture scale along the chosen dimension? Where do you expect the bottleneck to be?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Modify your architecture to remove the scalability bottleneck you have identified (show both logical, process and deployment view) - consider whether the API/interface of the bottleneck component should be improved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the scalability pattern you have introduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write an ADR regarding the issue of component discovery, choosing one of the alternatives: dependency injection vs. directory. Can you identify an existing component playing the role of directory/dependency injection container? Could you give an example of where you would need to add such component to facilitate dynamic component discovery?</p>

<section class="instructions "><p>Only dead software stops changing. You just received a message from your customer, they have an idea. Is your architecture ready for it?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a new use case scenario. Precisely, what exactly do you need to change of your existing architecture so that it can be supported? Model the updated logical/process/deployment views.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pick another use case scenario so that it can be supported without any major architectural change (i.e., while you cannot add new components, it is possible to extend the interface of existing ones or introduce new dependencies). Illustrate with a process view, how your previous design can satisfy the new requirement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change impact. One of your externally sourced component/Web service API has announced it will introduce a breaking change. What is the impact of such change? How can you control and limit the impact of such change? Update your logical view</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open up your architecture so that it can be extended with plugins by its end-users. Where would be a good extension point? Update your logical view and give at least one example of what a plugin would actually do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming you have a centralized deployment with all stateful components storing their state in the same database, propose a strategy to split the monolith into at least two different microservices. Model the new logical/deployment view as well as the interfaces of each microservice you introduce.</p>
