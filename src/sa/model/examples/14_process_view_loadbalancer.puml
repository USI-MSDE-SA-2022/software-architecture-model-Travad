' Authentication in the meanwhile
PBI -> AAD: Check the attempt of a user to enter the platform
AAD -> AAD: Verify authentication of the user
AAD -> PBI: Provide authentication success or failure

' The data API service attempts to query and reach out to check if any ETL job is schedule
PBI -> DAPI: /GET (query)

' Query the operational DB in the meantime
MASTER -> ODB: Query
ODB -> MASTER: Query result 

' What if a request arrive in the middle of a ETL process?
DAPI -> MASTER: Any scheduled ETL process?
MASTER -> DAPI: Yes

' Complete the job in the meantime
MASTER -> PARTITION: Generate partitions for the workers
PARTITION -> MASTER: Partitions generated
MASTER -> W1: Assign job to worker
MASTER -> W2: Assign job to worker
W1 -> MASTER: Job result
W2 -> MASTER: Job result
MASTER -> ADB: Merge result

' Alert the schedule is done
MASTER -> DAPI: Scheduling is over

' Re-attempt to retrieve the data
PBI -> DAPI: /GET (query) re-attempt
DAPI -> ADB: Query

ADB -> DAPI: Query results
DAPI -> PBI: Forward the data of the request
PBI -> PBI: Render the graphs and display them to the user
